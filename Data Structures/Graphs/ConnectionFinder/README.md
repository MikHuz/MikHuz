## Social Network Connection Finder

### Abstract:
This program simulates a **social network** by creating a **unidirectional graph** to represent social connections between people. Using **breadth-first search (BFS)**, it finds and outputs the people who are connected to a given source person within a specified degree of separation.

### How It Works:
1. The program first prompts the user to input the **number of people** in the network.
2. The user then provides a list of **people's names**.
3. The user inputs the **number of direct connections**, followed by pairs of names indicating connections.
4. The user specifies a **source person** and the **degree of separation** to search for.
5. The program outputs all individuals who are **exactly the specified degree** away from the source person.
6. If no one is found at the specified degree, it prints **"NONE."**
