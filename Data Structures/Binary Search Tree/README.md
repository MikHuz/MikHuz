## Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

This program implements a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** and provides operations for:

- **Adding a node** to the tree
- **Preorder traversal**
- **Postorder traversal**
- **Calculating the height** of the tree
- **Counting the number of leaves** (nodes with no children)
- **Counting the number of nodes with exactly one child**

The program allows user input via commands to manipulate the tree and retrieve information about it.

### Commands:
- **`add <value>`** – Adds a node with the specified value to the tree.
- **`height`** – Returns the height of the tree.
- **`preOrder`** – Returns the preorder traversal of the tree.
- **`postOrder`** – Returns the postorder traversal of the tree.
- **`countLeaves`** – Counts and returns the number of leaf nodes in the tree.
- **`countOneChildNodes`** – Counts and returns the number of nodes with exactly one child.
