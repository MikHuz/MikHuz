This project is an image and video search, combined with AI image generation as well. 
It is utilizing the Pixabay API to return images, Pexels API to retrieve videos based on keywords, and RapidAPI to generate AI content.
Two options exist, one to show a grid view of the images/videos, and one to get a slideshow of them
You may zoom in on an image by hovering over it, and additonally you may click the image to open it in a new window to better view and download.
Zooming in on videos naturally applies with the fullscreen function provided by html.

To Run: Install the following python modules: requests, flask, bootstrap-flask. Once done, cd into the project, and run the project with "flask --app app --debug run"

Future Work: Stylizing the project a bit more to appear more attractive, adding options for a user to manage how much results they wish to display.
