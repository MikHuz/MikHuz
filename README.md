## Hi, I'm Michael Huziy! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from California State University, Monterey Bay, eager to apply my skills in entry-level software engineering roles. I have an interest in software development, problem-solving, and data-driven solutions. I enjoy tackling technical challenges, building efficient solutions, and continuously expanding my skill set. Iâ€™m especially interested in thinking about and working with data, backend development, and optimization. This repository is a compilation of some of my recent, ongoing and future work across various domains. Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and growing as I advance in the industry! ðŸš€
